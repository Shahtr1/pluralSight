/*
 * 	Most applications do not stand alone
 * 		Rely on classes in other packages
 * 		JDK packages located automatically
 * 		May need help locating other packages
 * 
 * 	Locating packages at development time
 * 		Specific to each IDE
 * 		
 * 	Locating packages at runtime
 * 		Java provides a number of options discussed below
 * 
 * 	Default Class Loading
 * 		By default Java searches current directory
 * 			Classes must be in .class files
 * 				Must be under packages directories
 * 		As long everything is in one directory 
 * 			C:\myDir> java onlineCoaching.controllingAppExec.ClassLoading
 * 			and import other packages in main class
 * 			But in many cases having these only in one directory may not be practical
 * 	
 * 	Control the way classes are located
 * 		Specifying Class Path
 * 			Can provide the list of paths to search
 * 				Searched in the order they appear
 * 				Current directory used only if in list
 * 			Two options for specifying class path
 * 				Environment variable
 * 				Java command option
 * 	
 * 		Specifying Class Path as Environment variable
 * 			Can specify as an environment variable
 * 				Variable named CLASSPATH
 * 			Becomes default path
 * 				used by all programs that dont provide a specific path
 * 			Use environment variable with caution
 * 				Changing for one program can break another
 * 			
 * 			C:\myDir> set CLASSPATH=\otherDir
 * 			//----      Classes loaded from \otherDir      ----\\
 * 			C:\myDir> java onlineCoaching.controllingAppExec.ClassLoading
 * 		
 * 			This isnt safe
 * 			Now moving to safer way
 *
