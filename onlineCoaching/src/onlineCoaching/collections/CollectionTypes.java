//Collection Types
/*
 * 	Types associated with collections are interfaces and actual classes
 * 	
 * 	Collection interfaces
 * 		provide contract for collection behavior
 * 	Collection classes
 * 		Provide collection implementation
 * 		Implement 1 or more collection interfaces
 * 
 *////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 /*
 * 	Common Collection Interfaces
 * 
 * 		Interface			Description
 * 
 * 		Collection			Basic collection operations
 * 		List				Collection that maintains a particular order
 * 		Queue				Collection with the concept of order and specific "head" element
 * 		Set					Collection that contains no duplicate values
 * 		SortedSet			A set whose members are sorted			
 * 	/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 * 
 * Common Collection Classes
 * 		Classes				Description
 * 
 * 		ArrayList			A List backed by a resizable array
 * 							Efficient random access but inefficient random inserts
 * 		LinkedList			A List and Queue backed by a doubly-linked list
 * 							Efficient random insert but inefficient random access
 * 		HashSet				A Set implemented as a hash table
 * 							Efficient general purpose usage at any size
 * 		TreeSet				A SortedSet implemented as a balanced binary tree
 * 							Members accessible in order but less efficient to modify and search than a HashSet
