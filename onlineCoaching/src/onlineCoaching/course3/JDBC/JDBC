Two Interfaces which encapsulates the data returned from the database
	Statement
		Used for executing a static SQL Statement
		Methods:
			ResultSet executeQuery(String SQL)
				used for executing a select statement and it returns a ResultSet object where the ResultSet object maintains the result generated by the SQL select select statement
			int executeUpdate(String SQL)
				is used to INESRT, UPDATE and DELETE statements, and also SQL DDL(Data Definition Language) statements.This method returns an integer which identifies the number of rows returned by the statement
			boolean execute(String SQL)
				only used in unusual circumstances by the most sophisticated programmers. The execute method should be used only when its possible that the statement may return one or more than one ResultSet object or update counts or both of their combinations
				
	ResultSet	
		Java.Sql.ResultSet interface represents the result set of a database query
		A ResultSet object maintains a cursor that points to the row in the ResultSet which helps navigating from one row to the other.
		When the ResultSet is first returned, the starting cursor position is before the first row of data(Its not pointing to any data at first, we have to move the cursor)
		
		Methods
			Navigational Methods(cursor movements)
				beforeFirst()
				afterLast()
				first()
				last()
				previous()
				next()
				getRow()
				
			Get Methods
				get method for each data type
				Each get method has two versions
					One that takes in a column name
					One that takes in a column index
				
			Update Methods
			
		
		
	
		ResultSet Types
			Type_Forward_Only(default ResultSet type)
				The cursor will always move forward only direction
			Type_Scroll_Insensitive
				The cursor will move forward and backward and the ResultSet is not sensitive to changes made by others to the database that occur after the result was created
			Type_Scroll_Sensitive	
				The cursor will move forward and backward and the ResultSet is sensitive to changes made by others to the database that occur after the result was created
			
		ResultSet Concurrency Types
			Concur_Read_Only(default)
			Concur_Updatable
				
	
	
		With MySql the default ResultSet object is scrollable, which means that you can move the cursor up and down, going anywhere you like
		but with any databases along with Oracle the default is forward only, meaning the cursor will start before the data and you will be able to move forward to the end but you wont be able to move back again 
	
Steps for Development Process
	Establish Connection to a database
	Create Statement Object
	Execute SQL query
	Process the ResultSet
